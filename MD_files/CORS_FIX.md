# CORS Issue - Fix Applied ‚úÖ

## What Was Fixed

1. **Enhanced CORS Configuration:**

   - More permissive in development mode
   - Better handling of preflight OPTIONS requests
   - Added comprehensive headers support
   - Improved logging for debugging

2. **Added Request Logging:**
   - Now logs all incoming requests with their origin
   - Shows CORS decisions in console

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Restart Backend Server

**You MUST restart your backend server** for the changes to take effect:

1. **Stop the current backend server** (if running):

   - Press `Ctrl + C` in the backend terminal

2. **Start it again:**

   ```bash
   npm run start:backend
   ```

3. **Look for these new log messages:**
   ```
   üì• POST /api/rentals - Origin: http://localhost:5173
   ‚úÖ CORS: Allowing origin in development: http://localhost:5173
   ```

## üîç Debugging

If CORS errors persist after restarting:

1. **Check backend console** - You should now see:

   ```
   üì• OPTIONS /api/rentals - Origin: http://localhost:5173
   ‚úÖ CORS: Allowing origin in development: http://localhost:5173
   ```

2. **If you see CORS warnings**, check what origin is being sent

3. **Verify backend is actually running:**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3002/api/health
   ```

4. **Check browser Network tab:**
   - Look at the OPTIONS preflight request
   - Check response headers for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

## üìã Checklist

- [ ] Backend server restarted with new code
- [ ] Backend console shows request logs
- [ ] Browser Network tab shows OPTIONS request succeeds
- [ ] POST request works after OPTIONS

## üö® If Still Not Working

Check these:

1. **Is backend actually running?**

   - Open: http://localhost:3002/api/health
   - Should return JSON

2. **What port is frontend on?**

   - Check Vite console - should show port (usually 5173)
   - Backend will log the origin

3. **Browser cache?**

   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Or clear cache

4. **Check backend terminal:**
   - Should see request logs when form is submitted
   - Should see CORS allow/deny messages
